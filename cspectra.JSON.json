      "text": "A link to the referenced paper: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/871\nThis paper has been widely cited by scientific publications.\nNevertheless, the question is widely debated, so different opinions exist in the field.\n\nWe all know dogs were domesticated from wolves by humans, but on which continent did this first take place? Did people in Africa, Eurasia, America and Australia domesticate wolves separately, or did one of them succeed first, then propagate the new species to the other continents?\n \nBiologists and archaeologists have been working together using genetic analysis to find out the geographic origin of dogs. By comparing DNAs of modern dogs and wolves with those of ancient dogs remains, they have found out that modern dogs most likely originated from Europe. \n\nThe conclusion was based on the genomic data from 18 ancient dog remains. These remains were found in areas today known as Belgium, Russia, USA, Argentina, Switzerland, and Germany. Genetic Analysis shows that the ancient dog remains found in Belgium were the earliest to emerge, and are on the highest node of the evolutionary tree of dogs. \n\nHowever, because no ancient dog remains have been found in Asia or Middle East, it is still unknown whether an earlier origin is located in these area. So the geographic origin of dogs still needs further investigation.\n\n Nevertheless, the study of the continental origin of dogs, combined with the knowledge of human history, can help us understand how human migration has facilitated the evolution of animals. Moreover, the mutual love for dogs among people in different regions, also reflects some universal values that all human beings want to preserve, regardless of their different locations and religions.\n\nAttributions by order of appearance:\nBy One or more images by AlexCovarrubias, Corticopious (Continental models.gif) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nBy brian0918\u2122 (Own work) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nBy Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nBy Dr. Karl Rothe, Ferdinand Frank, Josef Steigl [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nBy NordNordWest (File:Spreading homo sapiens ru.svg by Urutseg) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons",

      "text": "In case you are planning an Airbnb trip: unregistered short-term rentals are banned in many areas in UK, Canada and USA, while the rest of the world are relying mainly on luck. In the UK\u2019s case, an Airbnb host was sued by the real estate company for breaching the contract between them. A clause in their contract says the house is \u201cfor private residence\u201d only, and the company sued her for renting rooms in the house to guests for just days or weeks. The company\u2019s argument is that such rentals constitute private residence for neither the host nor the guests, and their neighbours\u2019 life was disturbed. The court agreed with the company and decided that short-term rentals should not be allowed in such cases. Since such \u201cfor private residence only\u201d clause is very common in real estate contracts, this case has virtually set a precedent for banning all short-term rentals on Airbnb in UK, and hosts who break this law can be punished with a large amount of fine, and even lose the ownership of their houses. Following the case in UK, in last year\u2019s December, Canada\u2019s court also gave a precedent-setting decision to ban such short-term rentals. Their considerations were even more close to the economic and social impacts of Airbnb than the United Kingdom\u2019s. In cities like Toronto and Vancouver, where buying a house is almost impossible for young people, long-term rentals are vital to the stability of society. When an Airbnb host decides to put an apartment on the website for short-term rental, there will be one apartment fewer in the market for long-term rentals. Since the price of short-term rental is considerably higher, it is not surprising that many apartments are advertised as short-term rentals. In addition to the negative impact on the real estate market, driven by profits, hosts can choose to ignore the necessary measures for safety and may cause serious harm to their guests or neighbourhood. In its home country in the United States, Airbnb is still struggling to reach various agreements with State governments. It settled with the New York City last year to agree on the City\u2019s punishing hosts for short-term rentals, using the constitution to defend its freedom of speech and to avoid reducing short-term listings on its website. But in this year\u2019s case with San Francisco, Airbnb has essentially agreed to help the government to register its hosts, collecting data of hosts who rent their rooms for less than a month and sharing data with the government for registrations. In New Orleans and Chicago, Airbnb has reached similar agreements.",

      "text": "Suspicion on the expenses of the treasury secretary's trip around solar eclipse has raised this question again: is the space owned by a few powerful figures or by the international community?\n\nOuter Space Treaty:\nhttps://www.state.gov/t/isn/5181.htm\nUnder this treaty, the outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies is shared by the whole international community. The Treaty bans States from claiming territories in space, and from deploying nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction in it.  The outer space is used by States regardless of their social or economic influence, and its exploration is intended for the benefit of all countries. Significant international cooperation such as the International Space Station has been made since this treaty entered into force. \n\nSo if Asgardia is recognized as a State by the United Nations, which means a State can claim territory in space, then the Outer Space Treaty\u2019s intention of keeping the space as an international resource may be compromised. After all, if one bilionaire can create an Asgardia, it won\u2019t be difficult for other bilionaires to create Asjedi, Asjoda, or some other bizarrely named Space Nations, all they have to do is to gather some data from people and send them into space with a satellite.\n\nIt is fair to say it\u2019s a cool thing to hold a passport issued from the space, but will governments in such Space Nations be effective or will they become tax havens for very rich people, while the rest of their promises, such as religious freedom and non-discrimination, become as void as the outer space? What will happen when Asgardians are able to be sent to a platform in the space, while other earthly citizens have to watch them flying over their heads? Will there be more wars on Earth because people are eager to get a ticket into space? Will there even be wars in the colonies in space? All these questions remain to be answered in the future.",

      "text": "Reference: http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndjicl/vol6/iss1/15/\r\nOuter Space Treaty: https://www.state.gov/t/isn/5181.htm\r\n\r\nAsteroid mining will no longer be a fantasy of comic books and science fictions in the near future. Science and technology have rapidly developed to enable us to find out the important minerals in asteroids that can be used to produce electronic devices on earth, and support space travel outside earth. If enough investments can be placed in this adventure, resources extracted from asteroids can be used to refuel space shuttles after they have left earth and dramatically decrease the cost of asteroid mining.  Currently there are already several large corporations making investments in it with the support from their governments.\r\n\r\nThe other side of this huge opportunity is the extreme danger in it. Because currently there is only one effective treaty that regulates space exploration, which is the Outer Space Treaty, and there is a loophole in this treaty that allows corporations or individuals to claim territories in outer space, this opens possibilities for national governments to control territories in space through the corporations under their regime. If each country passes its own laws to allow its corporations to have property rights to the asteroid they mine, then what happens if one corporation from China and another one from the U.S. both mine the same asteroid in space? If we use the old way of colonization in space, then we will have endless wars to fight, because of the huge number of asteroids out there. That is why asteroid mining can be a disaster for human civilizations, and why new international space law is necessary to asteroid mining.\r\n\r\nAttributions by order of appearance:\r\nLaunch of Apollo 15: By NASA  [Public domain], via WIkimedia commons\r\nSTS115_Atlantis_undock_ISS.jpg: NASA derivative work: The High Fin Sperm Whale (STS115_Atlantis_undock_ISS.jpg) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\r\nDawn spacecraft in asteroid belt.jpg: By NASA [Public domain],via Wikimedia Commons\r\n433eros.jpg: By NASA/NEAR Project (JHU/APL).

      "text": "Can a human being marry a robot? This largely depends on culture and legal constraints. As for the intelligence of machines, today it is no doubt that a robot can think and act as rationally as humans, or even better. When faced with temptations in life, humans seem to act irrationally according to their own feelings, but robots can analyse the situations and search for solutions logically without being affected by hormones or mental disorders.\nOf course, the main issue of humans marrying robots is that they won\u2019t give birth to any children. But this is rather a minor problem, since there will always be marriages between men and women. As long as the laws give equal protections to all kinds of marriages, there won\u2019t be any conflict between different groups. Therefore, people should be more tolerant to different kinds of love and marriages. Such tolerance is of great benefit, since humans will be satisfied with more job opportunities and available resources instead of facing the problem of large populations as the result of uncontrolled births. \nAnother question is, can a robot provide the same affection as a human partner? This in fact relies on the assumption that marriage depends on love instead of companionship. As we all know, romantic movies end either with the scenes of a tragic death of at least one of the couple, or end with the scenes of the couple getting married. The fact that the story ends there already tells the truth that there is no romance anymore after that. So instead of asking if a robot can love its partner as a human, maybe people should ask if humans can actually do that. If the answer is yes, then we can program such love into a robot and let it learn to love, if not, then a rational robot partner can replace a human partner without any loss.",

      "text": "Let's first think about vectors. A vector can be viewed as an array of numbers, where each of its element represents a quantified feature of the same object. A common use of vectors is in the representation of forces in physics, a force is decomposed to three dimensions that are orthogonal to each other, which suits our understanding of a 3-dimensional world. But if you have learnt linear algebra, then you already know that a vector can have more than 3 dimensions. In mathematics, a vector can have as many dimensions as you want. So why do we bother to create an n-dimensional vector in a 3-dimensional world?\r\n\r\nThe answer is we need these dimensions to help us analyse an object from as many perspectives as we can. For example, the statue of liberty can be represented with a 3 -dimensional vector, including its height, width and length. But this is still very limited. If you want to study the years when different sculptures were created, so that you can gain a better understanding of the history of sculpture, you'll need to attach a 4th dimension to represent the year to each of the sculpture. You can even add a fifth and a sixth dimension to represent the latitude and longitude of the place where it was created, so maybe you can find some interesting patterns. Were all sculptures that depict the natural figure of humans created in Europe? Were all sculptures of animals created in Asia? By adding more dimensions, you can understand a certain object more thoroughly, and have the ability not to be confused if you have seen many of them.\r\n\r\nSince adding more dimensions gives us more information, it's not surprising that high dimensions are commonly used in data analysis in many fields, such as clinical research, financial systems, and many other areas. With the freedom of creating more dimensions, we can break the limitations of a 3d world, and avoid being bombarded by the explosion of information in a digital age.\r\n\r\nAttributions by order of appearance:\r\nBy Maschen [Public domain], from Wikimedia Commons\r\nBy Les Bossinas (Cortez III Service Corp.)

But how about a 10% error rate of the judgement in court? It means in every 100 cases, 10 of them are wrong. So if a lie detector with the error rate of 10% is used in deciding who is the killer, in each 100 such cases, there will be 10 that are wrongly identified. Scientists have already found out the error rates of all existing lie detectors, and currently, no method of lie detection has the accuracy that is high enough to be admissible in trials. That is why the courts are still not using lie detectors to decide cases, even when they are so popular nowadays.\r\nBut how about brain scans? Surely they sound more accurate and reliable than observations of someone's facial expressions, behavior changes, or even the measurement of heart rate. In fact, functional magnetic resonance imaging, has been widely studied in the use of lie detection. Scientists have carried out numerous experiments trying to find the associations between brain scan images and lying. Well, they did find something. They found out that lying is mentally taxing, which means lying causes certain regions of the brain to show more activities than other regions under brain scans. The problem is in the standards of determining if one is lying or telling the truth given the results of brain scans. As research was conducted more deeply, scientists found that the regions associated with lying in brain scans are also associated with executive function, attention and memory processes.\r\nFor example, if a person is trying to recall something that happened a long time ago, this technique could mistaken the activities of certain brain regions as the marks of lies, while in fact these regions are active because of memory processes. This is like the case in which you know that you need an umbrella when it rains, but you can't simply say that it is going to rain just because you happen to take your umbrella.\r\nThis is why even brain scans haven't been used in court trials for lie detection yet. We certainly hope one day there can be an effective technique to tell the lies from the truth, but this obviously still has a long way to go.",

      "text": "Determinism is a common belief among the general population. Microsoft News even  has a section in the category of lifestyle called \"horoscope\", updated everyday to get more readership.\r\nBut does popularity justify the belief in determinism? Researchers have found out that believing in determinism will increase the rate of cheating. They designed an experiment, allowed people to cheat if they didn\u2019t take active measures to stop it. They then compared the cheating rates between the group that was encouraged to believe in determinism and the group that wasn\u2019t, and found out that the cheating rate in the first group was higher. It is not difficult to understand since the group that believed in determinism would not withdraw from cheating if active measures were required. They would just take it for granted. For example, if someone believes that free will is just an illusion, when he receives extra changes from a cashier, it is more likely for him to keep the extra money than to take the trouble to remind the cashier and return it.  What does this mean? Simply believing in your genetic or environmental advantages will lead you to believe that your previous achievements have little to do with hard work, even if you have actually worked hard. So what happens when you are faced with a more difficult task? You are very likely to fail because you don\u2019t put enough effort into it. \r\n\r\nSo that is why you shouldn\u2019t believe in determinism.

I mean, yes, they are getting thinner and lighter, but after several hours of wearing them, it\u2019s still easy to feel eye strain. And the LCD displays of the headsets are just too glaring. Anyway, nowadays VR games are getting more and more popular. But wouldn\u2019t it be better to play VR games without a dumb headset? Turns out our brains have their own VR gaming systems, and we can play them every night. Scientists have found out that what we do in our dreams is exactly like playing virtual reality games, and it has connections with consciousness.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that during the REM sleep, which is short for rapid eye movement, dreams mainly show the features of primary consciousness, which includes perception and emotion. Scientists consider REM sleep a brain state which can be analyzed with techniques such as EEG and MRI, while \u201cdream\u201d is the information of what the brain does during REM sleep, often reported by the dreamer.  Human beings have a large amount of REM sleep before birth and in the first year after birth, it decreases afterwards as waking time and cognitive abilities increase,  but still remains about 1.5 hours per day in adult life. This suggests that REM sleep contributes a lot to the early brain-mind maintenance, and helps maintain the brain functions throughout life. Indeed, scientists have carried out experiments on rats, and found out that sleep-deprived rats lost weight and control of body temperature, and eventually died. Research also shows that the main function of dreams may not be just recollecting the dreamer\u2019s past. It is possible that the brain is preparing itself for its functions in future waking states, which is just like pilots practicing flights in a simulator before flying a real plane. ",

      "text": "Butterflies vs. Humans: Time Management\r\n\r\nHave you ever wished to become a butterfly, even just for a few weeks? Of course, in order to become an adult butterfly, you\u2019ll first have to go through the stages of caterpillar and pupa, and the life span of the adult butterfly is also much shorter compared to that of a human. But as humans, we\u2019re always up to some businesses, we are either stuck in the road traffic, or among the crowds in the streets or buildings. We have invented all kinds of devices to keep time, watches, clocks, smartphones, smart watches, and all kinds of softwares and apps to make schedules and remind us of an event. Besides these, politicians are constantly debating on the scheduling of healthcare and tax reforms, and all the other things. As a common person, you have to update your own schedules now and then, just to keep pace with the society.\r\n\r\nFor butterflies, time management is quite simple. Their adult life is very short, from a week to nearly one year depending on the species. Their tasks are simple, too. Born, migrate, and reproduce, butterflies don\u2019t need watches or smartphones to know the time, they use sunlight and temperatures to regulate the expression of genes, and develop a biological clock in their bodies to regulate their activities. They even use the direction of sunlight with their biological clocks to navigate their migration. They don\u2019t need to take any book in time management, or to sit in front of a computer to learn such courses. They just grow wings and fly in certain seasons naturally. One long-distance migration like the monarch butterflies\u2019 can reach up to 4000 kilometers, taking several generations of butterflies before they reach the destination. They migrate to a warmer place in the winter to escape the freezing temperature, and go back to the original place when the weather is warm. Compared to humans, butterflies don\u2019t need to drive cars or to line up to pass the borderline to go to another country, they also don\u2019t need to take any identifications or credit cards, or to worry about whether they can find a job or not after several months of travelling in the wilderness. \r\n\r\nSo as long as the nature still allows butterflies to thrive, we humans can only keep being amazed by their short and lovely lives. Just as Chuang Chou, the ancient Chinese philosopher once said,  \u201cNow I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man\u201d, the lives of butterflies have amazed us for thousands of years, and they will surely continue to in the future. \r\n\r\nReference:\r\nhttp://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/1734/20160257.long\r\nhttps://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(18)30253-7\r\n\r\n",
